MyCMS - Yet Another Django Based CMS.
=====================================

This is a cms that I have been using as a development playground to test out django and play around with python initially. I have used it in production at jnvilo.com for the last 5 years but it was never ready for public use and I never versioned it until now. I am iteratively preparing it for public consumption.
