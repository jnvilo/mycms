If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/issue/2510

To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.3) of PostgreSQL, see:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/upgrading.html

When installing the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
  ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

To install gems without sudo, see the Homebrew documentation:
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Gems,-Eggs-and-Perl-Modules.md

To have launchd start homebrew/versions/postgresql94 at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql94/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load homebrew/versions/postgresql94 now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql94.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
